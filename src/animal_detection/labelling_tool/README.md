LabelImg
========

LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool.

It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface.

Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used
by [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/).

This is a heavily modified version of the [original tool](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) that includes semi automated bounding box annotation by tracking, manual, semi- and fully-automated mask generation and interactive synthetic data creation.

This tool is currently under review for a patent application so its GUI components are not included here.
However, some of the backend python scripts are included to provide limited functionality described in the paper.
Please contact [ACAMP](https://www.acamp.ca/why-work-with-us/about/contact-us/) if you would like access to the full tool for research or commercial purposes.
